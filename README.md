# CS:APP Journey repo

A structured exploration of Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective (CS:APP) with notes, experiments, and exercises.

## Overview

This repo documents my progress through CS:APP.

- Summaries of each chapter (in my own words).
- Code experiments in C (and sometimes Assembly).
- Solutions and reflections on exercises.
- Extra experiments that go beyond the book.

The goal: deep understanding of systems programming—how software meets hardware.
